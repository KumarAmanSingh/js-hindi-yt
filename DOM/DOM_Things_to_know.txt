DOM basic structure is:

                        DOCUMENT
                           |
                          HTML
                            |
                  HEAD             BODY
                    |                |
              title   meta   heading   paragraph

->document.getElementById('title')  - gives title
->document.getElementById('title')  orjist write (title)
->title.innerHTML - gives innerhtml
->title.textContent - gives content present      
inside title
->title.innerText - gives content present      
inside title
-> the difference between them is innerText gives only text but innerContent will give the content which is not displayed means which is not visible

-> # is used to select ID
-> . is used to select Class
